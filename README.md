For our project we wanted to visualize UFO report data. We did this by making a word cloud, a relation diagram as well as a map relation.

Reid Malone's contributions:

I was responsible for the word cloud. This takes in all of the data from a set range (which the user can set if they want) and displays
the top shape that was reported within the given time period.

Something that I noticed is that "Light" was always the number one shape. As you can see below in the two different date ranges.
