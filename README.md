For our project we wanted to visualize UFO report data. We did this by making a word cloud, a relation diagram as well as a map relation. The dataset used was a pre-made .csv file obtained here: https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports. It was almost comical seeing the amount of reports on the 4th of July each year. I guess that's when all the UFO's come out.

I was responsible for the word cloud. This takes in all of the data from a set range (which the user can set if they want) and displays
the top shape that was reported within the given time period. The word cloud works by setting the font size based upon how many occurances there were of that certain shape. The word cloud was inspired and used a library from https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud.

Something that I noticed is that "Light" was always the number one shape. As you can see below in the two different date ranges.
